# AV_Research_NavMesh_Stoplight_Test
Different ideas to built a road system for an AV simulation utilizing NavMesh. Spring 2020

This project is a simple test of using the NavMesh and Raycasting together. Click any place in the road for a destination for the car. The car will move there using NavMesh. To turn the stoplight red and stop the car press "R". To make the stoplight green, press "G". The car then will move to the destination the user clicked.
